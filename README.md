# Measles in the US

This repository includes a notebook to reproduce a [visualization by the Wall Street Journal](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/#b02g20t20w15)  about the incidence of measles over time, which the brilliant [Brian Granger](https://github.com/ellisonbg) adapted into a [computational example for the Altair library](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ellisonbg/altair/blob/master/altair/notebooks/12-Measles.ipynb).

There are two versions included:
+ ORIGINAL_Measles_Example.ipynb (with all code included which can be executed from top to bottom)
+ WORKSHEET_Measles_Example.ipynb (scaffolded to allow building up the code line-by-line)
